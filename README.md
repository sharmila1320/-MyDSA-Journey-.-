My journey from 0 to DSA mastery ‚Äì clean code, patterns, and problem-solving. ·∂ª ùóì ê∞Å .·êü                                                                                      
# My current state in DSA on 23-06-2025 :                                                                                                                                   
I knew most of the basic to medium DSA concepts conceptually ‚Äî arrays, hashing, two pointers, sliding window, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, searching, sorting.
I could walk you through the logic in theory, but when it came to implementation, I struggled:                                                                              
‚ùå Couldn't write clean or structured code                                                                                                                                 
‚ùå Found it hard to solve even easy problems end-to-end                                                                                                                     
‚ùå Had never touched graphs, heaps, or advanced patterns                                                                                                                   
That day, I decided:                                                                                                                                                          
Enough theory ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to grind. I need to move-on and put an end to my overthinking, cause that's when I will become a true DSA master and a great Developer !            
This repository documents my full journey:                                                                                                                                    
From being stuck at ‚ÄúI kind of get it‚Äù ‚Üí to becoming a DSA problem-solver with clean, confident code.                                                                         
# Day 01 : 24-06-2025                                                                                                                                                         
I gave chatgpt (literally my second brain atp) to give day 01 goals assuming I'm gonna master DSA at OA and Interview-ready level in 25 days with 4hours on weekdays and more on weekends along with contests and periodic revision of what I'm doing everyday ! (this was the exact prompt I used)                                                         
after asking it to be brutally honest , I directly asked chatgpt to give Day 01 goals:                                                                                        
Proud to say that along with 4 problems as day 01 goals , I alongside completed striver's first video sums on arrays !                                                        
Total of 6 basic logic clarifying problems : (listing them below for you)                                                                                                     
1.largest element in array                                                                                                                                                    
2.second largest element in an array                                                                                                                                          
3.check if array is sorted                                                                                                                                                    
4.remove duplictaes from sorted array                                                                                                                                         
5.left rotate array by 1                                                                                                                                                     
6.left rotate array by d places                                                                                                                                              
I completed these , tried first on my own , and then watched striver video explanation and wrote clean code by myself. Wrote detailed yet concise notes ! And when i solved a question , right after I reported chatgpt how I started solving it, how I proceed and then watched explanation video which helped me to write clean code ! Later , after listing problems i solved to chatGpt , I asked it to create an excel sheet with periodic revision dates for all the problems , and it gave me one - I downloaded it !         
This boosted my confidence and made my spirits sky-rocketed . Today , it took me 6hours with all dilly-dallying and time buffers !                                            
# Day 02 : 25-06-2025                                                                                                                                                        
Next day , i asked chatgpt in the same chat to resume after day 01 and give me day 02 goals , and followed the same startegy as first day and to my surprise & since I already know what to do, how to proceed and all after day 01, I completed day 02 goals in just 3 hours! Yayyyyyy! Good thing : I got this holyNairBall(a trend now in IG) idea of documenting this on my git repo and so I'm here , hehe !                                                                                                              
Listing the next set of problems I solved below :                                                                                                                             
6. Left Rotate Array by d places(Revised)                                                                                                                                     
7. Move All Zeroes to End                                                                                                                                                     
8. Linear Search in Array                                                                                                                                                     
9. Union of Two Sorted Arrays (Brute & Optimal using 2 pointers)                                                                                                              
10. Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays (Handled TLE, optimized with 2 pointers) (still lacking little clarity in implementation tho !)                                         
11. Right Rotate Array by k places (Brute and Optimal approach)                                                                                                               
12. Maximum Subarray Sum (Brute and Improved)                                                                                                                                 
13. Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm (Understood and implemented after dry run and guidance)                                                                                                
Also I decided to do DSA Mastery journey in 2 streams : one is this plan and the second one is starting today , I will start with Trees (but can't be regular-only when I'm free: probably 3 goood hours at night ) - so that I won't fall too behind for OAs and Interviews which mostly focus on these advanced concepts !                              
 # Day 01 of Advanced DSA : 25-06-2025

# Day 03 : 26-06-2025
I was feeling dead tired today , since it's a long day ! I usually tackle DSA first thing in the morning, but I got a lot on my plate today, I ended up doing just 2 Problems in depth late at night !                                                                                                                                                       The important thing is I showed up even after feeling so tired and little sick, also my eyes gave up cause all day long , I work with systems !                                So today , I solved :
1. Union of two arrays(unsorted) : Started with brute force approach , learnt a lot about set and vector usage and then moved onto other methods!
2. Intersection of two unsorted arrays(just my brute force solution)
conclusion ?! Happy that I showed up even when I was dead tired !
